Sun et al. [53] leverage the soft-argmax operation to retrieve joint locations from heatmaps in a differentiable manner, which allows end-to-end trainingã€‚
Tian et al. [54] propose direct pose regression in the one-stage object detection framework.
 Zanfir et al. [64] use normalizing flows to build a prior on SMPL joint angles for their weakly-supervised method.
